Route Configuration: In your user-router.mjs file, you can use the authentication middleware (authenticateToken) by including it as a parameter before the route handler where authentication is required.
In the example provided by your teacher, the authenticateToken middleware is applied to the PUT request route for updating user information (/:id). This means that authentication is required before a user can update their information.
